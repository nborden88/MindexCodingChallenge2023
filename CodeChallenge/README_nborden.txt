#Mindex Coding Challenge 2023
# Developer Nicholas Borden notes and remarks

Hello!

I appreciate your time looking reviewing the changes I have made with this solution.

I really enjoyed the challenge of completing the two tasks provided with the provided solution!
I regrettably got stuck and was not able to resolve a racing condition I was experiencing with the Employee Direct Reports. 
I look forward to hearing your feedback on this particular part, in addition to any other comments that you may bring up.
I value listening and taking in remarks comments regarding my coding and development, as I feel that is how I become better at what I do.

Again, thank you for taking the time to reviewing my code. I look forward to hearing from you soon regarding this challenge, and what the next steps are in the process to work at Mindex. 


I hope you have a great day!

Sincerely,

Nicholas Borden
